# UPDATE 8/31/2022
Unfortunately, FACE is no longer online. After Discord made reading message content a privileged intent and QuizDB shut down, FACE's functionality was impaired enough that we decided to discontinue to project. Please feel free to adapt the code to the new Discord API standards and keep studying hard!
